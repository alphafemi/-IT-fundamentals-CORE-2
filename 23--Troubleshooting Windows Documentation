🔧🔧🔧Troubleshooting Windows Documentation
This guide provides steps for diagnosing and resolving common Windows issues, from boot problems to performance slowdowns. Use systematic approaches like checking logs, running diagnostics, and applying updates to identify root causes.

🔧Bluescreens and Frequent Shutdowns
Address critical errors causing system crashes.
BSOD (Blue Screen of Death): During startup/shutdown; caused by bad hardware, drivers, or apps.
Resolutions:
Use Last Known Good, System Restore, or Rollback Driver.
Try Safe Mode.
Reseat or remove hardware if possible.
Run manufacturer hardware diagnostics or BIOS tools.

🔧Sluggish Performance
Identify and fix slowdowns affecting usability.
Tools: Task Manager for CPU/I/O checks.
Checks:
Windows Update for latest patches/drivers.
Disk space and defragmentation.
Power-saving mode on laptops (may throttle CPU).
Anti-virus/anti-malware scans for infections.

🔧Boot Errors
Resolve issues preventing Windows from loading.
Errors: "Operating system not found" or "Missing operating system."
Causes: Boot loader changes or multiple OS installations.
Steps:
Check/remove boot media.
Use Startup Repair.
Modify Windows Boot Configuration Database (BCD) via Recovery Console: bootrec /rebuildbcd.

🔧Startup Repair
Fix boot-related failures.
Missing NTLDR: Main boot loader absent; run Startup Repair, replace manually, or disconnect removable media.
Missing OS: Incorrect Boot Configuration Data; run Startup Repair or configure BCD.
Safe Mode boot: Indicates normal startup failure; use Startup Repair.

🔧Starting the System
Troubleshoot device or service startup issues.
Device not starting: Check Device Manager and Event Viewer; often bad drivers—remove/replace.
Services failed: Bad driver/hardware; start manually, check permissions/dependencies.
Windows services: Verify system files.
App services: Reinstall application.

🔧Applications Crashing
Diagnose app failures for stability.
Symptoms: Errors or sudden closures.
Tools:
Event Log for details.
Reliability Monitor for history and fixes.
Resolution: Reinstall app or contact support.

🔧Low Memory Warnings
Manage RAM shortages.
Cause: Apps require more RAM than available.
Steps:
Close high-memory processes via Task Manager.
Increase virtual memory: System > About > Advanced system settings > Performance > Settings > Virtual memory.

🔧USB Controller Resource Warnings
Resolve endpoint limitations in USB controllers.
Issue: Devices exceed controller endpoints (e.g., 96 or 254 max).
Solutions:
Move device to different USB port/interface (USB 2.0 may support more endpoints).
Match USB version to device (e.g., USB 3.X for higher endpoint capacity).

🔧System Instability
Address general failures like hangs or errors.
Diagnostics:
Hardware: Manufacturer tools, storage/memory checks.
OS: Run SFC (System File Checker); anti-malware scan.

🔧Slow Profile Load
Fix delays in roaming user profiles.
Cause: Network latency to domain controller; slow policy/script application; LDAP queries.
Issue: Client may select remote DC over local.
Resolution: Optimize infrastructure for local DC preference.

🔧Time Drift
Correct clock inaccuracies.
Cause: Internal clocks drift over time.
Fix: Enable automatic time setting in Settings > Time & language > Date & time.
Note: Manually set time zone if privacy settings interfere.
