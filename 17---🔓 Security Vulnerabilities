Security Vulnerabilities Documentation
This guide addresses common security vulnerabilities, including non-compliant systems, unpatched software, unprotected configurations, end-of-life products, and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) risks. Proactive management is essential to maintain a secure environment.

Non-Compliant Systems:
Systems that don't adhere to standards pose ongoing risks due to constant changes.
----Challenges: Frequent updates and modifications make compliance difficult.
----Standard Operating Environments (SOE): Pre-tested and approved hardware/software sets, often as a standard OS image.
----Requirements: Must include OS and application patches, antivirus signatures; compliance can be verified before granting access.

Protecting Against Non-Compliant Systems
Implement controls to enforce and monitor compliance.
---OS Control: Apply policies to block non-compliant software installations.
----Network Monitoring: Use next-generation firewalls with application visibility to detect unauthorized traffic.
-----Scans: Perform periodic checks; login systems can scan and require fixes before access.

Unpatched Systems
Failure to apply patches leaves systems exposed to known vulnerabilities.
----Patch Cycles: E.g., Microsoft's Patch Tuesday (second Tuesday of each month at 10:00 AM PST).
----Risks: Unpatched systems become vulnerable immediately; organizations with thousands of devices (including critical services) are at high risk.
----Common Issue: Forgotten systems act as weak links, leading to breaches.
---Best Practices: Implement patch management—test, prioritize, and deploy updates systematically.

Unprotected Systems
Security features can hinder functionality, leading to insecure workarounds.
---Conflicts: Security measures may block applications, prompting insecure troubleshooting (e.g., disabling antivirus or firewalls).
---Avoidance: Don't permanently disable protections; instead, master secure troubleshooting techniques.
---Analogy: Fixing a bad lock by removing the door isn't a solution—address the root issue.

Product Support Lifetime
End-of-life products lack ongoing support, increasing vulnerabilities.
===End of Life (EOL): Manufacturer stops selling the OS but may continue support, including security patches.
===End of Service Life (EOSL): No more sales or support; no security updates. Premium support options may exist but are costly.
===Concerns: EOSL products can't receive patches, making them high-risk targets.

BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)
Employees using personal devices for work introduces security challenges.
---Ownership: Devices are employee-owned but must meet company standards.
----Security Difficulties: Blurs lines between personal and work use; data protection is complex.
----Risks: Data exposure on sold/traded devices; infected devices could leak proprietary information.
---Mitigation: Enforce policies like encryption, remote wipe, and regular scans; consider mobile device management (MDM) solutions.
