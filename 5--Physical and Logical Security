🔒 Physical and Logical Security: Protecting Your Assets! 🛡️

Security breaches can devastate businesses. Here's a guide to physical controls (locks, cameras) and logical measures (MDM, MFA)—from access vestibules to email filtering.

Physical Security:

--Access Control Vestibule: Mantrap doors—unlock one, others lock; prevents tailgating.
--Badge Readers: Magnetic/RFID/NFC for doors, time clocks, patrols.
--Video Surveillance: CCTV with motion detection, object/face recognition; networked/recording.
--Alarm Systems: Circuit-based (doors/windows), motion detection, duress buttons.
--Door Locks: Conventional, deadbolt, electronic (PIN), token (RFID/key fob), biometric (fingerprint/retina), multi-factor.
--Equipment Locks: Rack enclosures, locked cabinets for data centers.
--Staff Controls: Guards, ID badges, access lists, visitor logs.
---Barricades/Bollards: Prevent vehicles; channel access.
--Fences: Perimeter with razor wire; transparent/opaque.
--Key Fobs/Smart Cards: RFID for doors; certificate-based auth.
--Keys: Physical for standalone locks; use cabinets for auditing.
---Biometrics: Fingerprint/retina/palm scanners; hard to spoof.
--Lighting: Deters crime; aids cameras/recognition.
---Magnetometers: Detect metal objects.

Logical Security:
++Mobile Device Management (MDM): Manage BYOD/company devices; set policies, remote control.
++Least Privilege: Grant minimal rights/permissions to limit damage.
++Access Control Lists (ACLs): Allow/deny traffic/files based on IP/ports.
++Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Factors: something you know (password), have (token), are (biometric), do (behavior), are (location).
++Software Tokens: Authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator).
++SMS/Voice Call: Code via text/call; vulnerable to interception/spoofing.
++Email Filtering: Block spam/malware/phishing at gateway.
