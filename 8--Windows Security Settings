🔐 Windows Security Settings: Lock Down Your PC! 🛡️

Windows offers robust security features—from authentication to encryption. Here's a guide to users, permissions, UAC, BitLocker, and more.

**Windows Authentication:
Local Accounts: Tied to one device; no sync.
Microsoft Accounts: Sync settings/apps across devices; integrates OneDrive/Skype.
Domain Accounts: Centrally managed via Active Directory for enterprises.

**Users and Groups:
Users: Administrator (super-user), Guest (limited access), Standard Users.
Groups: Power Users (limited admin rights; deprecated in Vista+).

**Login Options:
Username/password (common).
PIN (local code).
Biometrics (fingerprint/face).
SSO (single sign-on for domains).

**Permissions:
NTFS vs. Share: NTFS applies locally/network; Share only network. Most restrictive wins (deny overrides allow).
Explicit/Inherited: Explicit set directly; Inherited from parent. Explicit takes precedence.

**Run as Administrator:
Grants admin rights to apps without full elevation.
Right-click > Run as administrator (even for admins).

**UAC (User Account Control):
Limits software access; prompts for changes.
Levels: Standard users (network/password changes); Admins (install apps, Remote Desktop).
Secure Desktop prevents automated access.

**BitLocker:
Full disk encryption (all editions except Home).
Protects data even if drive is removed.
BitLocker To Go for USB drives.

**EFS (Encrypting File System):
File/folder encryption on NTFS (all editions except Home).
Uses password/username for key; admin resets can lock files.

Best Practices:
Use strong passwords/PINs; enable biometrics.
Regularly review permissions; avoid unnecessary admin access.
Encrypt sensitive data with BitLocker/EFS.
