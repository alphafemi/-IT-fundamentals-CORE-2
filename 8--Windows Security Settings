🔐 Windows Security Settings: Lock Down Your PC! 🛡️

Windows offers robust security features—from authentication to encryption. Here's a guide to users, permissions, UAC, BitLocker, and more.

Windows Authentication
Authentication ensures secure access to the Windows desktop and network resources.
***Local accounts: Tied to a specific Windows device, allowing access only on that machine.
**Microsoft accounts: Enable syncing of settings across devices, integration with services like Skype, Office, and OneDrive for a seamless experience.
**Windows Domain accounts: Managed centrally via Active Directory, ideal for enterprise environments where accounts are controlled by a domain controller.

Users and Groups
Windows organizes access through users and groups to manage permissions effectively.
Users:
--Administrator: The super-user with full system control, including installing software and modifying system settings.
Guest: Provides limited access for temporary users, with restricted permissions.
Standard Users: Have basic access but cannot make system-wide changes without elevation.

Groups:
--Power Users: Historically offered more control than standard users, but permissions were largely removed in Windows Vista and later versions to enhance security.

Login Options
Multiple methods are available for logging into Windows, balancing convenience and security.
-- Username / password: The standard credential pair for authentication.
-- Personal Identification Number (PIN): A local access code for quick, device-specific logins.
-- Biometrics: Includes fingerprint or facial recognition for secure, password-less access.
-- Single sign-on (SSO): Uses Windows Domain credentials to sign in once and access multiple resources without re-entering credentials.

NTFS vs. Share Permissions
Permissions control access to files and folders, with different behaviors for local and network access.
--* NTFS permissions: Apply to both local and network connections, providing granular control over files and folders on NTFS-formatted drives.
--* Share permissions: Only affect network connections to shared folders ("network shares"). They do not apply to local access.
--* Most restrictive setting wins: If NTFS and share permissions conflict, the more restrictive one (e.g., deny) takes precedence.
--* Inheritance: NTFS permissions are inherited from parent folders unless explicitly changed or when moving to a different folder on the same volume.

Explicit and Inherited Permissions
Permissions can be set directly or propagated from parent objects.
** permissions: Manually assigned default permissions for a share or object, overriding inherited settings.
** Inherited permissions: Automatically propagated from the parent object to child objects, allowing one-time setup for entire folder hierarchies.
Precedence: Explicit permissions override inherited ones, even if the inherited permission is a deny.

Run as Administrator
Administrators have elevated rights, but standard users in the Administrators group don't get them by default.
---Administrator rights: Include editing system files, installing services, and other privileged actions.
---How to use: Right-click an application and select "Run as administrator" to execute it with elevated permissions. Alternatively, search for the app and choose "Run as administrator."
---Security note: This ensures that even admin users must explicitly elevate for sensitive tasks, reducing accidental changes.

UAC (User Account Control)
UAC limits software access to protect the computer from unauthorized changes.
+++ For standard users: Allows network access or password changes without elevation.
+++ For administrators: Requires consent for actions like installing applications or configuring Remote Desktop.
+++ Secure Desktop: Isolates UAC prompts to prevent automated access, enhancing protection against malware.

BitLocker
BitLocker provides full-volume encryption for data protection.
--- Full-volume encryption: Protects the entire drive, including the operating system, on all Windows editions except Home.
--- Protection against loss: Data remains encrypted even if the physical drive is removed and connected to another computer.
--- BitLocker To Go: Extends encryption to removable USB flash drives.
Usage: Requires a password or recovery key; losing access means data is inaccessible without it.

Security Best Practices

EFS (Encrypting File System)
EFS offers file-level encryption on NTFS volumes.
=== Encryption level: Applied at the file system level, securing individual files and folders.
=== OS support: Available on all Windows editions except Home.
=== Key management: Uses the user's password and username to encrypt the key. Administrative resets can make EFS-encrypted files inaccessible, so back up recovery certificates.
