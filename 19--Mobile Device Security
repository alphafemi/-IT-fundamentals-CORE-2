Mobile Device Security Documentation  
This guide covers security measures for mobile devices, including locking mechanisms, tracking, updates, encryption, backups, protection tools, policies, and IoT considerations. Mobile devices are portable and connected, making them high-risk targets for theft, loss, or malware.

Screen Locks
Restrict access to prevent unauthorized use, especially when devices are unattended.

Facial recognition: Unlock using biometric facial scans.
PIN: Set a personal identification number for quick access.
Fingerprint: Use built-in readers for biometric authentication.
Swipe: Draw a custom pattern to unlock.
Failed attempts:
iOS: Erases all data after 10 failed attempts.
Android: Locks the device and may require Google login or allow wiping.
Locator Applications and Remote Wipe
Track and secure lost or stolen devices using built-in GPS and location services.

Find your phone: Locate on a map via apps like Find My iPhone or Find My Device.
Remote control: Play sounds, display messages, or lock remotely.
Remote wipe: Erase all data to protect sensitive information if recovery is unlikely.
Patching/OS Updates
Keep devices secure with regular updates.

Device patches: Apply security updates to fix vulnerabilities.
Operating system updates: Include new features and bug fixes.
Importance: Stay current to avoid known security issues; delays can expose devices to exploits.
Full Device Encryption
Encrypt all data on the device to protect against physical access.

Mechanism: Device holds the encryption key; data is inaccessible without it.
iOS: From version 8, personal data is encrypted using the passcode.
Android: Likely encrypted by default from version 5.0 onward.
Remote Backup
Ensure data recovery for mobile, always-on devices.

Cloud backup: Automatic backups over the network without manual intervention.
Features: Constant syncing; wireless restores with one-click recovery after authentication.
Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware
Protect against mobile threats with built-in and third-party tools.

iOS: Closed, regulated environment; malware requires exploiting vulnerabilities.
Android: More open; apps can install from any source, increasing risk.
Sandboxing: Apps run in isolated environments, limiting data access.
Third-party options: Available from major providers for additional scanning and removal.
Firewalls
Control network traffic on mobile devices.

Built-in limitations: Most mobile devices lack firewalls, as traffic is primarily outbound.
Third-party apps: Available mainly for Android; not widely used.
Enterprise control: Use firewalls to allow/disallow app access in managed environments.
Policies and Procedures
Manage mobile devices in organizational settings.

BYOD (Bring Your Own Device): Handle both company-owned and personal devices.
Centralized management: Use Mobile Device Managers (MDM) for control.
Policies: Set rules for apps, data, cameras, etc.; control entire devices or partitions.
Access control: Enforce screen locks and PINs, even on single-user devices.
IoT (Internet of Things)
Secure connected devices, which often have weak security.

Examples: Sensors (heating/cooling), smart devices (home automation, doorbells), wearables (watches, health monitors), facility automation (temperature, lighting).
Vulnerabilities: Manufacturers prioritize functionality over security; use weak defaults.
Best practices: Isolate IoT devices on separate networks to limit exposure.
