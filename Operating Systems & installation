💻 Operating Systems: The Core of Computing! 🖥️  
*Operating system is the software running on a computing devices that control all the interactions between the hardware component of a devices.
*The operating system — the software that starts up your computer, begins its inner processes and handles upgrades, among many other things — is arguably the most important program on your P.C.

The OS manages hardware and software interactions. Here's an overview of key types, from desktops to mobiles.

Types:

+Microsoft Windows (Server): Industry-standard for PCs.
----Pros: Wide support, vast software options. 
----Cons: Complex integration, security vulnerabilities.
+Linux: Open-source, community-driven. Distributions: Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat. 
----Pros: Free, runs on any hardware. 
----Cons: Limited drivers for new devices.
+Apple macOS: Exclusive to Apple hardware.
----Pros: Intuitive, lower security risks.
+Chrome OS: Google-developed, Linux-based, cloud-focused.
----Pros: Simple, secure.
+Mobile OSes: iOS/iPadOS (Apple, closed-source), Android (Google, open-source Linux-based). 
----Pros: Optimized for mobility.

💻 Installing Operating Systems: Boot, Partition, and Upgrade! 🛠️

The operating system — the software that starts up your computer, begins its inner processes and handles upgrades, among many other things — is arguably the most important program on your P.C. 

Installing an OS? The guide below will help you plan your installation by explaining boot methods, partitioning and upgrades. Get it right the first time! 

------------Boot Methods: 
++USB storage (must be bootable). 
++Optical media (CD/DVD). 
++PXE Pixie -preboot execution environment (remote network install). 
++Hard-drives. 
++Internet (Linux, macOS Recovery). 
++External/hot-swappable drives--Boot from USB. 

------------Types of Installations: 
++++In-place upgrade (keep apps/ maintain existing data). 
++++Recovery partition (hidden installation files). 
+++++Perform a clean install (deleting everything). 
After that is done, use migration tools to move your files. 
+++++To fix Windows without harming your files, there is the option of a repair installation. 
+++++Remote network install (server/shared drive). 

----------Disk Partitioning: 
++++Separates drive into logical pieces (volumes). 
With GPT and UEFI, the drive can support up to 128 partitions and a maximum volume size of more than 9 zettabytes (ZB), or far, far beyond what drives are capable of now (assuming your system’s firmware completely implements the specification). 
+++With master boot record, an older partitioning scheme still found on many older drives, you have a limit of 2 terabytes (TB) and four primary partitions. 

+++In the past, the machines performed a slow reformatting, or “wipe,” of the entire disk. 
Now the cart uses a “quick format” — a new file table is created but the data is left recoverable. 
It writes zeros to your drive and checks for bad sectors. 

-------------Upgrading Windows 
The in-place method begins the migration from inside your operating system. 
With the wipe-and-reload method, you back up your system and let Windows erase the drive during installation. 
But you should still check the requirements lists, or use a tool like PC Health Check. 
MacOS gets one major annual feature update, with each operating system supported for 18 to 36 months.
