Social Engineering Documentation
This guide covers social engineering attacks, which exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. These methods are constantly evolving and can involve multiple people or organizations. Attacks may occur in person or electronically, such as aggressive phone calls or deceptive emails.

Effective Social Engineering
Social engineering manipulates individuals to gain unauthorized access or information.
Dynamic nature: Tactics change frequently, making prediction difficult.
Scale: May involve multiple attackers and organizations with interconnected ties.
Methods: Can be in-person or electronic, e.g., phone calls posing as customers or emails about funerals.

♻️ Phishing
Phishing combines social engineering with spoofing to trick users into revealing information.
Delivery: Often via email, text, or other channels.
Detection tips: Check URLs for legitimacy; look for inconsistencies like poor spelling, fonts, or graphics.
Vishing (Voice phishing): Conducted over phone or voicemail, using caller ID spoofing for fake security checks or bank updates.

♻️ Shoulder Surfing
Attackers observe users to steal sensitive information.
Opportunities: Easy in public spaces like airports, hallways, coffee shops, or flights.
Advanced methods: Use binoculars, telescopes, or webcams for remote surveillance.
Target: Access to important data for curiosity, espionage, or competitive gain.

♻️ Preventing Shoulder Surfing
Implement measures to protect against visual eavesdropping.
Awareness: Be mindful of surroundings and control input methods.
Privacy filters: Highly effective for limiting screen visibility.
Monitor placement: Position screens away from windows, hallways, or public views.
Travel tip: Avoid sitting in front of others on flights to prevent accidental exposure.

♻️ Spear Phishing
Targeted phishing using insider information for credibility.
Customization: Makes attacks more convincing by incorporating personal details.
Whaling: A form of spear phishing targeting high-level executives (e.g., CEOs) for large gains.
Common targets: CFOs or others with access to corporate bank accounts, allowing attackers to steal credentials.

♻️ Tailgating and Piggybacking
Physical access exploits where attackers follow authorized individuals.
Tailgating: Unauthorized entry by sneaking through doors without consent.
Piggybacking: Authorized entry with consent, e.g., holding doors for "busy" individuals.
Risk: Once inside, minimal barriers exist, as security often focuses on entry points.

♻️ Watching for Tailgating
Enforce policies to prevent unauthorized access.
Visitor policies: Require identification for all individuals.
Access rules: Enforce "one scan, one person" via policy or mechanical means.
Access Control Vestibule/Airlock: Physical barriers that allow only one person at a time.
Verification: Don't hesitate to ask questions like "Who are you and why are you here?"

♻️ Impersonation
Attackers pose as trusted individuals to gain access.
Tactics: Use details from sources like dumpsters; claim affiliation with help desk or higher ranks.
Deception: Overwhelm with technical jargon or build rapport (e.g., casual conversation about sports).
Example: Pretend to be from a high-level office while spouting fake technical terms.

♻️ Dumpster Diving
Searching trash for discarded sensitive information.
Method: Scavenge garbage bins (e.g., branded as "Dumpster") for bagged waste.
Value: Collect details for impersonation, such as names or phone numbers.
Timing: Target end-of-month/quarter or scheduled pickups for maximum yield.

♻️ Wireless Evil Twins
Malicious access points mimicking legitimate networks.
Setup: Configure a rogue AP with similar SSID, security, and captive portal to spoof real networks.
Execution: Overpower legitimate APs (not always requiring proximity); exploit open WiFi hotspots.
Protection: Use HTTPS and VPNs to encrypt communications, as users are easily fooled.
