Insider Threats and Injection Attacks Documentation
This guide covers insider threats, where trusted individuals pose risks, and injection attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). These exploit internal knowledge or poor programming to compromise systems.

Insider Threats
Insiders with access can cause significant damage, often leveraging institutional knowledge.
Beyond simple mistakes: Goes beyond insecure practices like sticky note passwords; some act maliciously.
Sophistication: May not require advanced skills, but insiders know vulnerable systems and how to target them effectively.
Impact: Extensive resources allow "eating away from the inside," leading to prolonged damage.

Recruiting Insiders
Attackers target insiders to bypass perimeter defenses.
Evolving tactics: As network security improves, attackers focus on insiders in an ongoing arms race.
Ransomware incentives: Offer Bitcoin for access; a single infection can yield millions.
Prevention: Stay vigilant with security fundamentals and maintain regular backups.

Code Injection
Injection attacks insert malicious code into data streams due to poor programming.
Mechanism: Exploits applications that fail to properly sanitize input/output.
Variety: Affects multiple data types, including HTML, SQL, XML, and LDAP.

- SQL Injection
SQL injection manipulates database queries to control applications.
SQL Overview: Structured Query Language, used in relational database management systems.
Attack Method: Modifies SQL requests by injecting code (applications should prevent this).
Consequences: If successful, attackers gain control over the database and the entire application.

 Cross-Site Scripting
Cross-site scripting (XSS) injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by others.
Mechanism: Exploits vulnerabilities in web applications to execute scripts in users' browsers.
Types: Reflected (non-persistent), stored (persistent), and DOM-based.
Impact: Can steal cookies, session tokens, or redirect users to malicious sites.
