🦠🦠Malware 🦠🦠
This guide covers malware, its types, methods of infection, and specific examples. Malware is malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or compromise systems. Understanding these threats is crucial for effective prevention and removal.

Malware Overview
Malware encompasses various harmful software that can disrupt, steal, or damage your system.
Common behaviors: Gathers information (e.g., keystrokes), participates in botnets, displays unwanted ads, or encrypts data.
Examples: Viruses, worms, and other forms that can ruin your day by locking or destroying files.

==Malware Types and Methods==
Malware comes in many forms, each with unique infection and damage methods.
##Trojan Horse: Disguises itself as legitimate software to trick users into installation.
##Rootkit: Hides in system files to remain undetected.
##Viruses: Self-replicating code that spreads via files or networks.
##Spyware: Monitors and collects user data for malicious purposes.
##Ransomware: Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption.
##Keylogger: Records keystrokes to capture sensitive information.
##Boot sector virus: Infects the boot sector to run before the OS loads.
##Cryptominers: Uses system resources to mine cryptocurrency without permission.

How You Get Malware
Malware often exploits vulnerabilities and user actions to infect systems.
-Combined attacks: Vulnerabilities allow initial malware installation, which may include backdoors for further infections like bots.
-User-triggered methods:
-Clicking malicious email links.
-Interacting with web page pop-ups.
-Drive-by downloads from compromised sites.
-Self-spreading worms.
-System vulnerabilities:
-Outdated operating systems—keep your OS updated.
-Vulnerable applications—check with publishers for patches.

*************8 Malware (explained)
 
🦠Trojan Horse
Inspired by the ancient Greek story, this malware masquerades as harmless software.
----Function: Pretends to be legitimate to bypass security; focuses on gaining control rather than replication.
----Evasion: May disable antivirus (AV) or avoid detection; once inside, it grants free access and can invite other malware.
----Detection: AV tools may catch it during execution, but advanced Trojans are designed to evade them.

🦠Rootkits
Originally a Unix technique, rootkits modify core system components.

----Mechanism: Alters kernel-level files to become invisible to the OS and traditional AV.
----Challenges: Undetectable via Task Manager; requires specialized removal tools.
-----Removal strategies:
+Scan for anomalies with anti-malware tools.
+Use rootkit-specific removers (often developed post-discovery).
+Enable Secure Boot in UEFI BIOS for added protection.

🦠Virus
Self-replicating malware that requires user execution to spread.

--Spread: Via file systems or networks; running infected programs can propagate it.
---Impact: Ranges from invisible to highly disruptive; new variants emerge weekly.
---Protection: Use updated antivirus with current signature files.
---Boot sector virus: Infects the boot loader, running before the OS; mitigated by UEFI Secure Boot, which prevents unsigned software from executing during boot.

🦠Spyware
Malware that secretly monitors and collects user data.
---Purposes: Advertising, identity theft, or fraud.
----Installation tricks: Via peer-to-peer networks or fake security software.
---Capabilities: Tracks browsing habits, captures keystrokes (keyloggers), and logs other data.

🦠Keyloggers
Specialized spyware that records user input.

---Data capture: Logs keystrokes, including URLs, passwords, and emails, bypassing encryption.
---Additional logging: May include clipboard contents, screen captures, instant messages, and search queries.
---Transmission: Sends captured data to attackers.

🦠Ransomware
Highly destructive malware that holds data hostage.

---Mechanism: Encrypts files (e.g., documents, photos) while leaving the OS functional to demand payment.
---Payment: Requires untraceable methods; uses public-key cryptography for encryption.
---Prevention: Regular backups and AV scans are essential.

🦠Cryptominers
Malware that hijacks system resources for cryptocurrency mining.

----Operation: Exploits "proof of work" math problems requiring heavy CPU/GPU processing.
----Infection: Can occur via websites (causing sudden CPU spikes) or persistent malware installations.
-----Impact: Drains system performance without user consent.

For prevention, keep systems updated, use reputable antivirus, and avoid suspicious links/downloads.
