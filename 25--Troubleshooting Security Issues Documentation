Troubleshooting Security Issues Documentation
This guide addresses common security-related problems in Windows, such as malware-induced network issues, false alerts, file alterations, and browser problems. Focus on detection, isolation, and removal to restore system integrity.

Unable to Access the Network
Malware can disrupt connectivity and performance.
Symptoms: Slow performance, lock-ups, or connectivity failures.
Causes: Poorly written malware code; malware controlling traffic or blocking updates/downloads.
Resolutions:
Scan and clean with anti-malware tools.
Reload OS or restore from known-good backup for guaranteed removal.

Desktop Alerts
Handle suspicious notifications, often mimicking legitimate alerts.
Issue: Browser push notifications claiming malware infections (real alerts come from antivirus).
Actions:
Disable browser notifications; create an allow list for trusted sites.
Scan for malware; consider full cleaning or rebuild from backup.

False Antivirus Alerts
Scams posing as security software.
Symptoms: Fake messages with logos, demanding payment to "unlock" PC or subscribe.
Removal: Use specific anti-malware tools or techniques; attackers are sophisticated.
Prevention: Only trust official antivirus software.

Altered System or Personal Files
Malware modifies or hides files.
Signs: Renamed/deleted/encrypted files; changed permissions; access denied errors.
Causes: Malware protecting itself or encrypting data (e.g., ransomware).
Resolutions: Use malware cleaners or restore from known-good backup; some are hard to remove.

Browser Security Alerts
Invalid certificates indicate potential threats.
Symptoms: Alerts for expired, mismatched, or untrusted certificates.
Checks: Click lock icon for details; verify time/date settings.
Actions: Avoid proceeding; scan for malware if persistent.

Browser Redirection
Unwanted redirects, typically malware-driven.
Symptoms: Searches lead to unexpected sites for ad revenue.
Causes: Malware altering browser behavior.
Resolutions: Anti-malware scan (may not fully remove); restore from known-good backup for certainty.
