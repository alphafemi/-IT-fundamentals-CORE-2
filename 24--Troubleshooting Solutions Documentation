Troubleshooting Solutions Documentation
This guide outlines common troubleshooting steps for resolving Windows issues, from simple reboots to advanced profile rebuilding. Start with basic fixes and escalate as needed, always backing up data first.

Reboot
A classic fix that often resolves transient problems.
Why it works: Clears bugs in router software, stops resource-heavy apps, or fixes memory leaks by resetting RAM.
Application: Reboot the router or system to refresh states.

Restart Services
Address background service issues similar to app problems.
Services: Run without user interaction; can have resource issues, memory leaks, or crashes.
Management: Use Task Manager > Services tab; right-click to start, stop, or restart.

Uninstall/Reinstall/Update Applications
Fix app-specific problems with installation tools.
Issues: Corrupted files or configurations.
Options:
Settings > Apps > Apps & features: Repair, reset, or uninstall.
Control Panel > Programs and Features.
Run setup again for additional options.
Repair: Replaces missing/corrupted files, fixes shortcuts/registry/drivers.
Reset: Removes all data for a fresh start.
Uninstall: Completely removes the app.

Verify Requirements
Ensure system meets minimum specs for OS/apps.
Check sources: Manufacturer requirements (often minimums); use System Information to view current config.
Resources: CPU, RAM, video, drivers, runtime libraries.

Add Resources
Upgrade hardware/software if utilization is high.
Monitoring: Task Manager for short-term; Performance Monitor for long-term analysis.
Actions: Compare to requirements; add/replace CPU, SSD, RAM; use Disk Cleanup for space.

System File Checker
Verify OS integrity.
Tool: Run sfc to check and repair system files.

Startup Repair
Fix boot issues.
Access: Settings > System > Recovery or Advanced Boot Options > Repair Windows.

Windows Restore
Revert to a previous system state.
Access: System > About > System Protection (if enabled).
Process: Select restore point; reboots to revert config (user data unchanged).

Reimage or Reload OS
Rebuild the system for complex issues.
Rationale: Faster than deep troubleshooting; use prebuilt images if available.
Options: Windows reset in Settings > Update & Security > Recovery (Win10) or System > Recovery (Win11).

Update and Patch
Keep systems secure and functional.
Windows Update: Centralized for OS/drivers; adjust active hours/metered connections.
Apps: Patch from publishers to address security beyond OS.

Roll Back Updates
Undo problematic updates.
View history: Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update (Win10) or Windows Update (Win11).

Rebuild Windows Profiles
Fix corrupted user profiles.
Symptoms: Logon failures, missing documents.
Process: Delete and recreate profile to force rebuilding.

Deleting Windows Profiles
Prepare for reconstruction.
Steps:
Log in as Domain Administrator.
Rename \Users\name folder (saves files).
Backup registry: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList > Export.
Delete registry entry; restart.

Reconstructing Windows Profiles
Complete the rebuild.
Steps:
Log in with user account to recreate profile/folder.
Log in as Domain Administrator; copy important files from old profile (avoid full copy to prevent corruption).
Logout as Admin; log in as user.
