Browser Security Documentation
This guide covers securing web browsers, a primary attack vector for malware, phishing, and data theft. Best practices include using trusted sources, verifying downloads, managing extensions, and enabling protective features to safeguard personal and sensitive information.

Browser Download and Installation
Download software only from reputable sources to avoid malware.
Trusted sources: Use official sites; attackers trick users into installing malicious software without exploits.
Avoid risks: Skip untrusted third-party sites, email links, or redirects; always navigate directly to the browser's official site.

Hash Verification
Verify downloads to ensure integrity and authenticity.
Install hash tools: Use command-line or GUI applications (e.g., from Microsoft Store) for checking.
Process: Compare the downloaded file's hash with the server's posted value, often including a digital signature.
Benefit: Confirms the file hasn't been tampered with during download.

Extensions and Plug-Ins
Install add-ons from verified sources to prevent compromise.
Trusted sources: Official libraries like Chrome Web Store or Microsoft Store; known-good websites.
Untrusted sources: Random sites or malware-installed extensions pose high risks.
Attack vector: Browsers handle most online activities, making extensions a common entry point for threats.

Malicious Browser Extensions
Extensions can harbor hidden dangers, as seen in real incidents.
March 2021 incident: Over 24 malicious Google Chrome extensions identified, spanning 40 domains, undetected by security tools.
Activities: Credential theft, keylogging, screenshots, and data exfiltration.
Advice: Distrust all software; maintain backups to recover from breaches.

Password Managers
Store and manage passwords securely for better protection.
Password vaults: Centralized, encrypted databases for all credentials.
Features: Cloud synchronization; generates unique passwords per site.
Options: Personal or enterprise-grade for corporate environments.

Secure Connections
Monitor for connection issues that indicate threats.
Alerts: Invalid certificates or security warnings signal problems.
Certificate checks: Verify expiration, domain match, and trusted authority signatures.
Time/date importance: Incorrect system time can cause false positives.

Enable Pop-Up Blockers
Block unwanted pop-ups to reduce phishing and malware risks.
Function: Prevents notification windows; usually enabled by default.
Control: Temporarily disable for troubleshooting; allow/block per site.

Clearing Private Data
Remove stored data to protect privacy and free space.
Data types: Browsing history, saved passwords, download lists.
Cache clearing: Deletes locally stored website parts.

Private Browsing Mode
Browse without leaving traces on the device.
Features: No history, download lists, or cached data stored; ideal for privacy or testing.
Cleanup: Data is removed when the browser closes.

Browser Data Synchronization
Sync data across devices for convenience, but with security awareness.
Sharing: History, favorites, extensions, and settings across computers, tablets, and mobiles.
Sign-in required: Use browser accounts for synchronization.

Ad Blockers
Control advertisements and tracking for enhanced privacy.
Built-in options: Some browsers block ads natively.
Tracking concerns: Sites may detect return visits; ad recognition can be challenging.
Security levels: Adjust settings to balance blocking and functionality.
