🛡️ Microsoft Defender Antivirus: Windows' Built-in Shield! 🦠



🦠 Malware lurks everywhere. Here's a guide to Microsoft Defender Antivirus—free, integrated into Windows 10/11, and powerful against threats.



**Built-in antivirus: Microsoft Defender Antivirus is included with Windows 10 and 11, eliminating the need for additional third-party antivirus software.



**Integration with Windows Security: Accessible via the Windows Security app under Virus & threat protection.





❗ Naming variations: It may not always display as "Defender Antivirus" due to historical name changes (e.g., previously known as Windows Defender or Microsoft Defender Antivirus).



Activating or Deactivating

++General advice: Avoid disabling your antivirus protection unless absolutely necessary for troubleshooting. Disabling it temporarily increases security risks, so proceed only if you understand the implications.



++Real-time protection: Defender Antivirus scans files and processes in real-time to detect threats.



++To enable or disable: Open the Windows Security app > Virus & threat protection > Manage settings > Toggle Real-time protection.



++Full deactivation: For complete disabling (not recommended), go to Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Manage settings > Turn off Real-time protection and other related features. Re-enable promptly after troubleshooting.



❗ But disabling Microsoft Defender doesn’t mean you should forgo antivirus protection entirely. Re-enable promptly after troubleshooting.



Updating Definitions

---Importance of updates: Antivirus effectiveness relies on the latest threat signatures (definitions). Outdated definitions can leave your system vulnerable.

---Checking for updates: Navigate to Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Check for updates.

Click the Check for updates button to manually scan for new definitions.

---Automatic updates: Typically enabled by default, ensuring definitions are downloaded and applied automatically from Microsoft servers. Verify this in the settings to confirm it's active.
