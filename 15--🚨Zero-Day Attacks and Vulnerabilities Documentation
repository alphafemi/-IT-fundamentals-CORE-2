🚨 Zero-Day Attacks, On-Path Threats, and Password Breaches: Advanced Cyber Dangers! 🛡️
This guide covers zero-day attacks, on-path attacks (formerly man-in-the-middle), and password attacks. These exploit undiscovered vulnerabilities or weaknesses in systems, networks, and authentication methods.

Zero-Day Attacks
Zero-day attacks target vulnerabilities unknown to developers or the public.
Vulnerabilities in applications: Many exist but remain undetected; attackers exploit them for personal gain while keeping them secret.
Good vs. bad actors: Ethical researchers share findings with developers; attackers hoard them.
Definition: "Zero-day" refers to exploits of unpublished vulnerabilities; these are increasingly common.
Tracking: Use Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database at https://cve.mitre.org/ for known issues.

Zero-Day Vulnerabilities
A real-world example highlights the risks of undiscovered flaws.
Log4j Remote Code Execution (December 9, 2021): Affected a Java-based logging utility from Apache, installed on millions of servers. Vulnerability introduced on September 14, 2013.
Timeline:
December 14: Fix released with extensive patching required.
December 17: Two new issues discovered, prompting widespread bug hunting.
Impact: Demonstrates how long-hidden vulnerabilities can cause massive disruptions once exploited.

- On-Path Attacks
On-path attacks intercept and manipulate traffic without detection

On-Path Network Attack
Attackers redirect traffic to eavesdrop or alter it.
Mechanism: Formerly called man-in-the-middle; redirects traffic to the attacker, who forwards it to the destination undetected.
ARP Poisoning: A common on-path attack on local IP subnets; exploits ARP's lack of security by spoofing responses.

On-Path Browser Attack
Malware on the victim's device acts as a proxy.
Mechanism: Formerly man-in-the-browser; malware/Trojan intercepts browser traffic, including encrypted data.
Advantages for attackers: Easy to proxy traffic; appears normal to the victim.
Example: Malware waits for bank logins to steal credentials and funds.

ARP Poisoning (Spoofing)
ARP poisoning manipulates Address Resolution Protocol to redirect traffic.
Process:
Legitimate ARP response from the default gateway (e.g., IP 192.168.1.1, MAC c8:bc:c8:a7:38:d5) is cached on the local device.
Attacker sends a spoofed ARP response claiming the router's IP (192.168.1.1) with their MAC (e.g., aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff).
Malicious ARP entry replaces the cached record, routing traffic through the attacker (IP 192.168.1.4, MAC aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff).
Result: Traffic intended for the router goes to the attacker, enabling interception.

Password Attacks
Password attacks exploit weak storage or guessing methods.

Plaintext / Unencrypted Passwords
Storing passwords without encryption is highly insecure.
Risk: Passwords are readable in plain text; anyone with file/database access gets all credentials.
Advice: Avoid applications that store passwords this way; switch to better alternatives.

Hashing a Password
Hashing converts passwords into irreversible digests.
Process: Creates a fixed-length string (fingerprint) representing the data.
Security: No collisions (different inputs yield different hashes); one-way function prevents recovery of the original password.
Common use: Standard for secure password storage.

The Password File
Password storage varies by system and application.
Variations: Different OSes and apps use unique hash algorithms for added security.

Brute Force
Attempts all possible password combinations.
Methods:
Online: Repeated login attempts; slow and often triggers lockouts.
Offline: Obtain user hashes, compute and compare; requires significant computational power.
Mitigation: Strong hashing algorithms slow down attacks.

Dictionary Attacks
Uses wordlists to guess common passwords.
Approach: Leverages dictionaries of common words, with substitutions (e.g., p&ssw0rd for "password").
Tools: Distributed cracking or GPU acceleration speeds up the process.
Limitations: Effective against weak passwords but fails on random strings.
