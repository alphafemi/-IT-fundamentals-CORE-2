🏢 Active Directory: Mastering Enterprise Management! 📂
Active Directory is a centralized database that stores information about network entities.

Database contents: Includes computers, user accounts, file shares, printers, groups, and other resources.
---Authentication management: Users log in using AD credentials, enabling single sign-on across the domain.
---Centralized access control: Defines which users can access specific resources, simplifying administration.
---Help desk usage: Commonly used for tasks like resetting passwords, adding/removing accounts, and troubleshooting domain-related issues.

Domain
A domain represents a logical group of users, computers, and resources.
---Domain name: Each domain has a unique name (e.g., company.local) associated with its group.
---Domain controllers: Servers that store the central AD database; AD is the service managing this directory.
----Troubleshooting relevance: Questions like "Is this computer on the domain?" or "Can you reset the domain password?" often arise during issue resolution.

Organizational Units (OU)
OUs help organize the large AD database into manageable hierarchies.
----Purpose: Group users, computers, and other objects for better structure.
----Hierarchy creation: Build custom levels, such as countries, states, buildings, departments, or even fictional ones like "Pegasus galaxy."
----Policy application: Assign policies to OUs, ranging from broad (e.g., Domain Users) to specific (e.g., Marketing, North America).

Login Script
Login scripts automate tasks executed during user login.
---Automation: Run a series of commands or tasks when a user logs in.
----Assignment: Associate scripts with specific users, groups, or OUs.
----Configuration: Link via Group Policy under User Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Scripts.
----Customization: Create different scripts for various OUs to meet specific needs.

Group Policy/Updates
Group Policies manage configurations for computers and users centrally.
---Management: Use local or domain policies via the Group Policy Management Editor.
---Central console features: Includes login scripts, network configurations (e.g., QoS), and security parameters.
---Updating clients: Force a policy update on a client using the command: gpupdate /force.

Home Folder
Home folders provide network-based storage for user files.
---Assignment: Map a user's home folder to a network share for centralized management and backups, reducing reliance on local storage.
---Automatic setup: When added to the user profile, directories are created with appropriate permissions.
---User training: Educate users to store files in the network home folder for consistency and security.

Folder Redirection
Redirects Windows Library folders to network shares for centralized access.
----Target folders: Includes Desktop, Downloads, Music, Documents, etc.
----Configuration: Set up via Group Policy under User Configuration > Windows Settings > Folder Redirection.
----Pairing with Offline Files: Enables offline access when not connected to the network.

Security Groups
Security groups simplify permission management by grouping users.
---Creation and assignment: Create a group, assign permissions to it, then add users.
---Built-in groups: Examples include Users, Guests, Remote Management Users, and Event Log Readers.
----Benefits: Saves time, reduces errors, and avoids assigning permissions individually.
